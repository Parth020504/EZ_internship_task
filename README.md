The web application has 2 parts
1. The login page, where the user enters his credentials which are then statically checked.
2. If correct, the user is directed to another page where he enters his name and uploads a few documents
3. Once the documents are uploaded, they are made visible in a simple dashboard
4. Alongside each document, there are 3 buttons (view,edit,delete).
5. Added a feature by which the user can actually view the entire uploaded document in a new window.
